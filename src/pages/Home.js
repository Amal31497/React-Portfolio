                    <p id="myStory">
                        I am an aspiring full stack software engineer currently finishing a coding bootcamp at the University of Washington. Originally, I am from Kazakhstan, and I have been to 13 different states. Currently I am residing in Santa Monica, California. I moved here because I love the beach and I am hoping to get a SWE position in one of the local companies. My programming experience is centered around the MERN stack. I am also quite familiar with MVC development model and used it in many projects. I enjoy good food and watching movies. Likewise I am a big fan of working out. As an ex-competitive professional swimmer, fitness plays a huge role in my life and mental health. Please get in touch with me if you have any questions or would just like to chat!
