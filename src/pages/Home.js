                    <h2>My Story</h2>
                    <p id="myStory">
                        I am a full stack web developer with hands-on experience in React and ASP.NET. 
                        I started my computer science journey during my BA Economics program at 
                        Indiana University in Bloomingtin by implementing regression analysis using a tool like Stata and fundamentals of Python.
                        College was also the time when I discovered web development - inbetween classes and my job at a coffee shop I used to dabble into 
                        making trivial web pages with just HTML, CSS and Javascript. After I graduated the university, I took some time to try different career paths.
                        Since fitness was the activity I was very much familiar with I took a route of a Personal Trainer. While training my clients I realized how much I revel in 
                        solving problems for them. Every client was unique and had a distinct set of training constraints in a form of injuries or specific goals. 
                        In the very beginning of 2020, when pandemia started I was forced to take a long break from training people and 
                        I decided to dedicate this time to do what I have been really wanting to since those attempts in web development in college. I signed up for a Coding Bootcamp
                        through University of Washington and had an absolutely amazing time learning fundamental and advanced web development skills.
                        My instructor and team that I was part of were the core drivers of my interactive learning. 
                        Every small problem I solved felt like a huge accomplishment to me and I continue carry on this attitude towards my work.
                        Right now I am developing several projects with ASP.NET and React to solidify my knowldege and stay in touch with the industry trends. 
                        My goal is to find a role that allows me to marry my passion for coding with scalable projects in React, ASP.NET, Node.js and many others.
